        "1. **Prepare your data**.\n",
        "The goal of this step is to create the data manifest files (in CSV or JSON format). The data manifest files tell SpeechBrain where to find the speech data and their corresponding text annotations. In this tutorial, the data manifest files are created by [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speech_recognition/mini_librispeech_prepare.py).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Train a tokenizer**.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Train a language model**.\n",
        "After that, we can train a language model. To do it, we need some large text corpus (better if the language domain is the same as the one of your target application). In this example, however, we  train the LM on top of the training transcriptions (for simplicity):\n",

        "4. **Train the speech recognizer**.\n",
        "At this point, we are ready to train our speech recognizer. In this tutorial, we will use the CRDNN model with an autoregressive GRU decoder. An attention mechanism is employed between encoding and decoder. The final sequence of words is retrieved with beamsearch coupled with the RNNLM trained in the previous step:\n",

        "## **Step 2: Tokenizer** \n",
        "An important decision to make when designing a speech recognizer concerns the basic tokens that our system has to predict (e.g, characters, phonemes, sub-words, words).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Using characters as tokens**\n",
        "One way is to predict characters. In this case, we simply convert the sequence of words into its corresponding sequence of characters (using the space '_' as an additional character):\n",
        "\n",
        "`THE CITY OF MONTREAL => ['T','H','E', '_', 'C','I','T','Y','_', 'O', 'F', '_, 'M','O','N','T','R','E','A','L']`\n",
        "\n",
        "Employing characters as basic tokens has some advantages and disadvantages:\n",
        "+ The total number of tokens to predict is very small (e.g, 20-30 tokens) and there will be enough training material for each one.\n",
        "+ With small atomic units like characters, we have the chance to generalize to words never seen during training. The system, in fact, can output any sequence of characters, including sequences never observed during training.\n",
        "+ The number of characters within a sentence is quite large and predicting long sequences is more critical than predicting shorter ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another option would be to estimate **phonemes** rather than characters. Phonemes are the basic sounds making up speech and they can be in principle a good choice. However, for many languages (e.g, English), the conversion from words to phonemes might not be trivial and requires phoneme annotation of each word (checked by human experts) in your dataset. For this reason, modern end-to-end speech recognizers do not use often phonemes as targets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Using words as tokens**\n",

        "`THE CITY OF MONTREAL => ['THE','CITY','OF','MONTREAL']`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is another extreme case that has some advantages and (several) issues:\n",
        "+ The advantage is that the output sequences will be short.\n",
        "+ The system, however, cannot anymore generalize to new words \n",
        "+ Moreover, some words might be observed only one or a few times in the training dataset. This way, we likely end up allocating tokens with little training material.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**\n",
        "What about something in between? \n",
        "This is what we are trying to do with BPE tokens. BPE is a simple technique inherited from data compression. The basic idea is to allocate tokens for the most frequent sequences of characters. For instance:\n",
        "\n",
        "`THE CITY OF MONTREAL => ['THE', '▁CITY', '▁OF', '▁MO', 'NT', 'RE', 'AL']`\n",
        "\n",
        "The article 'THE' and the preposition 'OF' are very common and we can allocate full tokens for them. Instead, we might wanna split \"MONTREAL\" into smaller pieces that are observed more frequently than the full word. \n",
        "\n",
        "The [algorithm that finds these tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) is very simple: we start from the characters and we count how many times two consecutive characters are observed together. We allocate a token for the most frequent pair and we iterate over and over until a specified number of tokens is reached. For more information, you can take a look at [our tutorial on the tokenizers](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12yE3myHSH-eUxzNM0-FLtEOhzdQoLYWe?usp=sharing).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *How many BPE tokens should I use?*\n",
        "The number of tokens is one of the hyperparameters of your system.\n",
        "Its optimal value depends on the amount of speech data available. Just to give you an idea, for LibriSpeech (i.e., 1000 hours of sentences in English) a reasonable number of tokens ranges between 1k and 10k.\n",
        "\n",

In this tutorial, we perform the so-called **shallow fusion** where the language information is used within the beam searcher of the speech recognizer to rescore the partial hypothesis. In practice, for every time step, we rescore the partial hypothesis provided by the speech recognizer with the language scores (that penalize sequences of tokens that are \"unlikely\" to be observed).\n",

Likely, most of the methods that we coded in the Pretrained class will fit your need. If not, you can override them to implement your custom functionality.\n",

For instance, we can create here a function that simply encodes a wav file using the `mytask_enc` module.\n",
